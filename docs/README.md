# DuckDB Shellfs Extension

[![DuckDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/DuckDB-community_extension-fdf1e0?logo=duckdb&logoColor=fff000)](https://duckdb.org/community_extensions/extensions/shellfs.html)
[![v1.5 build](https://github.com/Query-farm/shellfs/actions/workflows/MainDistributionPipeline.yml/badge.svg?branch=v1.5)](https://github.com/Query-farm/shellfs/actions/workflows/MainDistributionPipeline.yml?query=branch%3Av1.5)

The `shellfs` extension for DuckDB enables the use of Unix pipes for input and output. By appending a pipe character `|` to a filename, DuckDB will treat it as a series of commands to execute and capture the output. Conversely, if you prefix a filename with `|`, DuckDB will treat it as an output pipe.
